## how visualization works 
- user selectes a file and clicks on 'submit' 
  > CSV file is uploaded to the backend server via a rest API\
  > the server, satically hosts this file
- user clicks on 'Visualize' button and the following requests are made, 
  > POST request via data source API to create a new data source for the uploaded file\
  > GET request via Dashboard API to fetch the existing panels\
  > POST request via Dashboard API to add a new panel to the existing array of panels\
- (I have used an nginx proxy to get around the CORS error faced while making calls directly to the grafana server)
- user clicks on 'Save' 
  > documents are fetched from firestore and the container is populated
- user clicks on trash can
  > document is deleted from the firestore collection specific to the user
